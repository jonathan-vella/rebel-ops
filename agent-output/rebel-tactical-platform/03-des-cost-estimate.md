## Sensitivity Analysis

### Traffic Growth Scenarios

| Scenario        | Monthly Traffic | App Insights | Bandwidth | Total Cost | vs. Budget |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Current (demo)  | 5,000 visitors  | 1 GB         | 10 GB     | $13.60     | 68%        |
| Moderate growth | 10,000 visitors | 2 GB         | 20 GB     | $17.90     | 89%        |
| High traffic    | 25,000 visitors | 5 GB         | 50 GB     | $27.00     | 135% ⚠️    |

**Risk Mitigation**: Enable cost alerts at $16/month; consider App Insights sampling
reduction if traffic exceeds expectations.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ Deploy with Standard tier (required for managed Functions)
2. ✅ Configure App Insights sampling at 20 items/second
3. ✅ Set budget alert at $16/month (80% threshold)
4. ✅ Apply cost center tags to all resources

### Future Considerations

1. Review actual costs after 30 days against estimates
2. Consider reserved capacity if usage is stable
3. Evaluate Azure Front Door if multi-region required (+$35/month)
